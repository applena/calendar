### Description
Our app generates a calendar-like view that contains api-derived holidays, and any user-added hoildays (if any) for the current month (of October, wooh!)
___

### Problem Domain
There are many calendars out there, but most of them fail to showcase major foreign , lesser-celebrated, and religion-based holidays.<br>

We identified this gap, and created an app that will cater to people who want to see these less-recognized holidays as well as major holidays in one central location.

It is also a great way for people to read a breif description of holidays they are not informed of, that those in their workplace or community may celebrate.
